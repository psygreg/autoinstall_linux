# autoinstall_linux
Shell script for Arch-based Linux distributions that installs dependencies and applications to run most games, performs a full system update and creates a system restoration point using Timeshift.

**If all programs are installed, it will only update all system packages and create the restoration point.**

Use *autoinstall_NVIDIA* to install the latest proprietary NVIDIA drivers available from `nvidia-all`. Otherwise, use *autoinstall_AMD*.

You can open an issue to report problems or suggest additions and improvements to the script.
