# autoinstall_linux
Shell script for Arch-based Linux distributions that installs dependencies and applications to run most games, performs a full system update and creates a system restoration point using Timeshift.

**If all programs are installed, it will only update all system packages and create the restoration point.**

**Information on usage and packages installed in the Wiki:** https://github.com/psygreg/autoinstall_linux/wiki

You can open an issue to report problems or suggest additions and improvements to the script.
